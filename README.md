OpenCode is an early-development Go CLI tool that brings AI assistance directly to your terminal
through an interactive TUI, supporting multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.),
session management, and comprehensive developer tools including code execution, file modification,
LSP integration, and custom commands, making it a versatile terminal-based coding assistant with
both interactive and non-interactive modes.

```
Aider is an AI pair programming tool that runs in your terminal, allowing developers to collaborate
with large language models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek, OpenAI o1, and GPT-4o to build new projects
or work on existing codebases. The tool creates a comprehensive map of your entire codebase to work
effectively in larger projects, supports most popular programming languages, and automatically commits changes
with sensible commit messages while integrating seamlessly with git workflows.
